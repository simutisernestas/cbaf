# DONE:
 * sample more sequences by random start indexes
 * reduce low-high & open-close columns into single by subtracting them
 * try removing kl-loss? - doesn't affect too much

# TODO:
 * model naming by parameters used
 * make validation dateset
 * explore coinbase database for more data
 * read more about kl-divergence loss
 * next step ???
 * binance has a lot more data, collect that
 * spark doesn't take numpy floats, conver all types of DF to python floats
